# 🚛 Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem 
# A Brute Force Approach 💪

This repository contains an implementation of a brute-force algorithm to solve the **Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)**.  
The CVRP is a classic optimization problem that focuses on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles 🚐 with limited capacity to deliver goods 📦 to a set of customers.  

## ✨ Features  
- 🧠 **Exhaustive Search**: Explore all possible solutions to find the optimal routes.  
- 🛠️ **Customizable Inputs**: Configure vehicle capacities and customer demands.  
- 📊 **Visualization**: Analyze routes and performance metrics.  
- 🎓 **Educational Focus**: Ideal for small-scale problems and learning purposes.  

## 🚀 Use Cases  
This repository is perfect for:  
- 📚 Gaining insights into the CVRP and brute-force techniques.  
- 🔍 Comparing brute-force solutions with heuristics or metaheuristics.  
- 🧪 Experimenting with optimization on small problem instances.
